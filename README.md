# Covid-19-Prediction-using-Chest-X-rays

It is my Junior Design Project (CSE 299). My very own first CNN and Deep Learning Project. 
A Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Network based solution which can predict the Covid-19 positive and normal patients using Chest X-Ray images.
For testing the efficiency of the solution, I have used the dataset of Covid-19 positive and negative patient's Chest X-Ray images. 
For detection the disease user can login to this system and import his chest image and click on detect disease. It will give the result either it's covid or normal.
For Front-End i used GUI.
